# ControllerState
1. init: The robot is starting up. It will shift to state motors off when it has started.
1. motoroff: The robot is in a standby state where there is no power to the robot's motors. The state has to be shifted to motors on before the robot can move.
1. motoron: The robot is ready to move, either by jogging or by running programs.
1. guardstop: The robot is stopped because the safety runchain is opened. For instance, a door to the robot's cell might be open.
1. emergencystop: The robot is stopped because emergency stop was activated.
1. emergencystopreset: The robot is ready to leave emergency stop state. The emergency stop is no longer activated, but the state transition isn't yet confirmed.
1. sysfail: The robot is in a system failure state. Restart required.

# PCSDK Redistributable
A PC SDK application requires **RobotStudio** or **ABB Robot Communications Runtime** to connect to a controller in run-time. The latter is included in the RobotStudio installation. For the PC SDK to establish a connection either RobotStudio or Robot Communications Runtime must be installed on the PC hosting the PC SDK application. Robot Communications Runtime can be installed from <PCSDK>\Redistributable\RobotCommunicationRuntime, if RobotStudio is not installed.

1. RobotCommunicationRuntime安装目录：C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\ABB Industrial IT\Robotics IT，如果单独安装RobotCommunicationRuntime而不安装PCSDK，会多出一个文件夹C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\ABB Industrial IT\Robotics IT\RobVCCommon  
2. PCSDK安装目录：C:\Program Files (x86)\ABB\SDK\PCSDK 2022，安装PCSDK会自动安装RobotCommunicationRuntime，但是不会生成C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\ABB Industrial IT\Robotics IT\RobVCCommon目录下文件，原因未知。
