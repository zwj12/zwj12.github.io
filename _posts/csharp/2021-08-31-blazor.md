#  Razor
Razor is a markup syntax for embedding .NET based code into webpages. The Razor syntax consists of Razor markup, C#, and HTML. Files containing Razor generally have a .cshtml file extension. Razor is also found in Razor component files (.razor). Razor syntax is similar to the templating engines of various JavaScript single-page application (SPA) frameworks, such as Angular, React, VueJs, and Svelte.

# C#
Razor supports C# and uses the **@ symbol** to transition from HTML to C#. Razor evaluates C# expressions and renders them in the HTML output. To escape an @ symbol in Razor markup, use a **second @ symbol**. HTML attributes and content containing email addresses don't treat the @ symbol as a transition character.

	<p>@@Username</p>
	<a href="mailto:Support@contoso.com">Support@contoso.com</a>

# @()和@{}
@()直接计算表达式的值，然后渲染在页面上。@{}属于代码段，不会被渲染。但是@{}中代码会被顺序执行。代码块中支持HTML直接输出。

# Directives
CSHTML
	@{
	    var quote = "Getting old ain't for wimps! - Anonymous";
	}
	
	<div>Quote of the Day: @quote</div>
	The code generates a class similar to the following:

C#
	public class _Views_Something_cshtml : RazorPage<dynamic>
	{
	    public override async Task ExecuteAsync()
	    {
	        var output = "Getting old ain't for wimps! - Anonymous";
	
	        WriteLiteral("/r/n<div>Quote of the Day: ");
	        Write(output);
	        WriteLiteral("</div>");
	    }
	}
