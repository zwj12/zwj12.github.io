**aggregate()** is a terminal clause for a QuerySet that, when invoked, returns a dictionary of name-value pairs. The name is an identifier for the aggregate value; the value is the computed aggregate. The name is automatically generated from the name of the field and the aggregate function. If you want to manually specify a name for the aggregate value, you can do so by providing that name when you specify the aggregate clause
	
	>>> Book.objects.aggregate(average_price=Avg('price'))
	{'average_price': 34.35}

inspect the SQL with str(queryset.query) and write plenty of tests.
