# pel = picture element
An image is a two-dimensional array of values. Each element in the root image array is called a pixel or a pel (short for picture element). The value stored in each pixel of the image indicates the light intensity or brightness of each pixel. Typically, pixel values are integers, though other values may be used as well.

# cmT()
    MessageBox(NULL, cmT("Sample Code Complete"), cmT("Title"), MB_OK);

# ccCvlChar = wchar_t 

# ccCvlString = std::wstring
