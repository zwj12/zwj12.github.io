# SVN - Version Control
The components of the STRATON projects are stored in the repository as XML files. STRATON 
creates an exchange area where XML files are exported and shared with SVN as a local copy. 
This area is the directory “**\SC**” in the project folder. 

	C:\ProgramData\ABB\SQL2012\166e715b-e6a8-400a-86b0-6c7af6c69a0a\FILES\straton\PACK_ML\SC

# Cycle Time
如果zenon配置了现场总线，需要设置轮询时间，默认为0(Run as fast as possible)，否则可能会因为通信轮询太快而报警，报警内容可能为Timing configuration error. PLC utilization peaked at 1008%. Timing configuration error. 1 cycles lost.
